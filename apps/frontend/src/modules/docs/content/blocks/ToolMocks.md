# Tool Mocks Block

Tool mocks allow you to simulate external function calls and API responses.

## Why use Tool Mocks?

- **Determinism**: Ensure tests are predictable and don't depend on external live services.
- **Speed**: Avoid latency of real network calls.
- **Cost**: Save on API usage costs during testing.

## Configuration

Define the tool name, expected arguments, and the response you want the LLM to receive.
